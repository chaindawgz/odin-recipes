<h3>This is a picture of scrambled eggs set on a plate, garnish on the top, ready to be consumed.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Melt your butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high until it gets bubbly; diner-style scrambles do not fear heat.</li>
    <li>While butter melts, break eggs into a small bowl. Use a fork to beat them like they owe you money until completely blended and slightly frothy. Stir in the pepper and salt.</li>
    <li>Add egg mixture to pan; start pulling the eggs from the sides of the pan into the middle (the edges cook faster than the center). Big, fluffy curds will start to form--exactly what you want. Keep it up, pulling the eggs from around the pan for about 3 minutes. The second all the runny egg is fully set--there's an eggshell-thin line between fluffy, firm eggs and tough, dry ones--pull the pan from the heat and slide the eggs onto your plate.</li>

</ol>
